### Why this site was chosen

Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn is the site of high levels of traffic violence, a problem which is especially bad at high traffic intersections such as Flatbush Avenue, Fort Greene Place, and 4th Avenue. These five-to-six-lane dangerous streets are bordered by narrow sidewalks, and lack any protected bike infrastructure either on the streets or nearby. The car-centric infrastructure of Atlantic Avenue contributes to a long list of other negative externalities: asthma rates are high, street trees are few and far between, and the lack of permeable surfaces means that flooding is common. The communities around Atlantic Avenue are disproportionately exposed to truck noise, vibrations, particulate matter, and emissions from diesel engines because the street carries truck volumes comparable to a highway.
