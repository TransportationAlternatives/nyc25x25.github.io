With retail stores, restaurants, subway stations spanning nearly the width of Manhattan, it&rsquo;s a true backbone in a neighborhood with 79 nursing homes, hospitals, childcare centers, and schools. 79% of households within walking distance of 125th do not own a car, and 71% commute by bike or public transit.<br><br><em>&ldquo;Despite unsafe conditions, W125th street is a key bike corridor between East and Central Harlem and the Hudson River Greenway. There are no alternatives because of geography (Morningside Park to the south and St Nicholas Park to the north) and street design (W126th street is a one way street). We need crosstown protected bike lanes providing a safe corridor from the East River to the Hudson River on 125th street or a street next to it (e.g. 126th street).&rdquo; -Erik M</em>',
