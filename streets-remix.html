                  <p class="card-text"><em>Shovel-Ready NYC 25x25 Streets</em> marks a first-of-its-kind partnership between Transportation Alternatives (TA), the New York City-based advocacy organization with a mission to reclaim New York City’s streets from cars, and Via, the global transportation technology company. This collaboration was built with Remix, a collaborative mapping platform for transportation planning and decision-making, and inspired by <em>NYC 25x25</em>, a plan to convert 25 percent of space for cars in New York City into space for people by 2025.</p>

                  	<p style="padding-top: 1em">Our hope for this partnership is to inspire cities around the world to convert space for cars into space for people, and to pursue these goals in a more efficient and collective way. This project, which was inspired by advocates, planners, and community members, demonstrates a new way to redesign streets by creating technical, actionable plans that incorporate globally-recognized best practices for street design and reflect specific input from the community.</p>
                  	<p>These tactical site-specific redesigns of some of New York City’s most lethal and problematic streetscapes were created with a new, faster, more responsive process — because to reduce car space 25 percent by 2025, we cannot go intersection by intersection, with a six-month feasibility study each time. The proposals shown here include input from urban city planners, who are experts in the technical components of street design, and from advocates and community members, who are experts in their local streets.</p>
                  	<p>We must radically rethink the infrastructure that shapes transportation. Like metropolitan areas and cities around the world, New York City needs innovative solutions that no longer center drivers as the most important constituency and cars as the primary method of transportation. We must radically rethink the infrastructure that shapes transportation. This vision, and the ability to implement it, starts with identifying gaps in what we have today. Based on peoples’ experiences of the street, we can create actionable designs for a safer, more efficient, and more equitable use of public space — designed for people, pedestrians, cyclists, seniors, kids, and small businesses — to make any city as dynamic as it can be.</p>

              <p>In early 2021, Transportation Alternatives (TA) launched <em><a href="https://nyc25x25.org/25x25report.html" target="_blank">NYC 25x25: A Challenge to New York City&rsquo;s Next Leaders to Give Streets Back to People</a></em> which proposed a radical reimagining of how public space is allocated and used in New York City.</p>

              <p>The plan included a challenge to the next leaders of New York City: Convert 25 percent of current parking and driving space into space for people by 2025. By giving a fraction of the street back to people, the City of New York can save lives, improve air quality, build climate resilience into every roadbed, and set the tone for the future of New York as a vibrant city with accessible, efficient transportation and a robust, thriving street life.</p>

              <p>Mayor-elect Eric Adams endorsed <em>NYC 25x25</em> along with a coalition of more than 200 disability rights, economic, educational, environmental, labor, and public health organizations across New York City. Now, we present a set of real-world designs that reflect the expertise of local communities and planning experts, showcasing the power of community-input in creating streets for people and a new way to accelerate the work of reclaiming space from cars. These designs were guided by the on-the-ground expertise of TA&rsquo;s five borough organizers and committees of volunteer activists, and created using Remix Streets&mdash; Via&rsquo;s street design and mapping software &mdash; to demonstrate how collaborative planning could direct life-saving and truly equitable street redesign projects.</p>

              <p>This project offers a new paradigm for street planning and advocacy, demonstrating a more collaborative and efficient way to put forward actionable plans for a better, safer use of street space. It should also serve as a library of resources for advocates, planners, and engineers looking to bring a <em>NYC 25x25</em> vision to their most problematic streets.</p>

              <h3>The problem</h3>

              <p>Today, New York City&rsquo;s streets are at a standstill. The result of these delays is tragic: New Yorkers are killed and severely injured on our streets every day, their families left bereft, while the City of New York fails to make investments in solving the systemic problems or to rally the political will necessary to shift the dominant paradigm. The pace of work is not on scale with the problem and there is a desperate need for new tools to speed the pace of change without sacrificing the expert input of communities.</p>

              <p><strong>Inefficient Streets</strong></p>
              <p>Prioritizing car movement and storage directly disadvantages the majority of New Yorkers, who do not own cars. People who live outside New York City drive 4.4 million cars and trucks through city neighborhoods every day. As a result, New York City buses are the slowest in the nation.</p>

              <p><strong>Unsafe Streets</strong></p>
              <p>Nearly one third of all New Yorkers have been in a traffic crash, and 70 percent of New Yorkers know someone who has been injured or killed in a crash. These numbers increase for Black New Yorkers, New Yorkers over 50 years old, New York City households that make under $50,000, and residents of Staten Island. Car crashes seriously injure or kill a New Yorker every two hours. Today, traffic violence is at the highest levels it has been at any time in the past eight years.</p>

              <p><strong>Inequitable Streets</strong></p>
              <p>Though a minority of New Yorkers drive a car to work and a supermajority walks, takes public transit, or rides a bike, most of New York City&rsquo;s streets are designed for a car-driving minority. An overwhelming 96 percent of New Yorkers walk to and from public transit, but public space devoted to the movement and storage of cars includes some 19,000 lane miles for driving and three million free on-street parking spaces &mdash; accounting for more than 75 percent of our shared streetscape. The remaining scraps of space are devoted to car-free bus lanes (0.02 percent), bike lanes (0.93 percent), and sidewalks (24 percent). But the inequity of New York City streets is more than spatial; it is racial and economic. Low-income communities and communities of color bear the burden &mdash; longer commutes, hotter neighborhoods, worse air pollution, higher asthma rates, more health conditions related to car pollution, and more premature deaths. The Bronx &mdash; the borough with the highest rate of poverty &mdash; is also home to the highest childhood asthma rates, but only six percent of all on-street protected bike lanes in New York City, and only six percent of bike share docks.</p>

              <p> These facts and statistics reflect a status quo of streets that are unsafe, inefficient, and inequitable. It is a disheartening reality, but it does not need to be this way.</p>


              <h3>The Solution: Collaborative, Community-Driven Planning</h3>

              <p>There is a known-solution to inequitable, ineffective, and unsafe streets: Redesigning those streets with changes that prioritize moving people over cars. While the infrastructure required to change the status quo of New York City streets is well documented, the collaborative process of identifying problems and developing community driven solutions can be difficult.</p> 

              <p>What follows are five site studies demonstrating what is possible when community-driven planning is catalyzed by technology. These site studies are the product of data, research, and community input, and the result is five tactical solutions to five dangerous, inefficient streets, and a demonstration of what’s possible when people come together to make our streets safer.</p> 


              <p>Built with Remix, these site studies also showcase collaboration and community input in two directions: from the top down, such as when the New York City Department of Transportation seeks community input on a plan for a street redesign, and from the bottom up, such as when a community seeks changes to a streets from the Department of Transportation — all contained in a cloud-based planning tool using real data. The ideas on the following pages are site-specific but the ideas are backed by the global relevance of streets and intersections with similar designs.</p>
